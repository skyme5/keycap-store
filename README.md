# Keycap - A keylogger for Windows

## Introduction

Keycap is a simple keystroke logger for Windows XP or newer Windows desktop and server operating systems. It logs the pressed key along with the date and time of the press and the title of active window.

> It is intended solely for educational purposes. Keycap is meant to demonstrate one approach to software based keyboard API logging. Keycap does not require system wide kernel hooks or other low-level integration. It can be executed by normal users.

## Compiling

Keycap is written in `C++11` and uses a few Windows specific functions and types. Any modern `C++11` compiler that targets Windows should be able to build it. See `Makefile` for compiler settings used with MinGW (g++).

If you prefer to use MSVC++, download the free Visual Studio Community Edition, create an empty Win32 Console Application project and add the Keycap files (one source, one header) to the project, then build.

## Character Notes

The `|` character is used to separate fields in the output so that character is logged as the word 'pipe' rather than the character itself. Some Window titles may include the `|` character. Window titles are enclosed in quotations, however, additional `|` characters may cause parsing/rendering issues with certain csv parsing programs. If you record keystrokes to a file `Keycap.exe > log.csv`, be prepared to handle those issues.

> Keycap does not log all characters/keys on a typical U.S. QWERTY keyboard. See if you can figure out what keys are missing and add them to the source, or modify the code to work with different keyboards and languages.

## MSDN Types & Keyboard API Notes

- `short`: Holds signed 16-bit (2-byte) integers that range in value from `-32,768` through `32,767`.
- `GetAsyncKeyState`: returns a short.
- `HWND`: handle to a window.

When `GetAsyncKeyState` returns, if the most significant bit is set, the key is down, and if the least significant bit is set, the key was pressed after the previous call to `GetAsyncKeyState`. (`-32768:1000000000000000`) (`-32767:1000000000000001`)

In `keycap.hpp` some keys use constant names such as `VK_TAB` or `VK_RETURN` while other use the decimal (57) or hex (0x39) representation for keys. If you add keys, experiment with which form is accepted on your system. Some systems will take any form while others may only take one.

## Conclusion

Remember that Keycap is meant solely for educational purposes and demonstration. It could be written very differently. The code is meant to be explicit and obvious so that it can be easily understood and modified.
